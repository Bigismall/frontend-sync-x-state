# xstate-demo

Just a simply (pure TypeScript and HTML) of the [x-state](https://xstate.js.org/) machine usage.
Fell free to use  [X-state visualiser](https://stately.ai/viz) to display `machine` definition from [index.tsx](src/index.ts) file, to see it in action

P.S. This repo is the second part of the state management story (Frontend sync). First part available here: https://github.com/Bigismall/frontend-sync-state-reducers
